## Usecase / Features

```
The main reason I created this application was to get notified whenever my Mac was fully charged.
So that I don't overcharge my MAC. Overcharging your laptop can affect its battery life and reduce the overall performance of the system.

Features:

1. Send Emails via your icloud account to any other email to get notified.
2. Get Toast notifications when your mac is fully charged.

Upcoming Features:

1. Notifications via Whatsapp.
2. Free Notification Text Service.
```

## Usage

```sh
python filename.py
```
